Monty Hall Problem simulator

This code simulates the Monty Hall problem. 
Pretty straightforward. The .csv file stores the following data:
                         Wins and losses if the player switches
Expected outcome after multiple runs (more is better): a wins:losses ratio of 2:1. 

Only my second project. Work in progress.
